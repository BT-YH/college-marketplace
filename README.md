This was a group project for my **CS360 database** class taken at *Gettysburg College* in _Fall 2023_. I hate to admit it, but my group (three people) really procrastinated and this whole site was put together within 48 hours... Lesson learned:

> Don't leave a semester-long project to the last days!

I might update and improve this website when I get a chance.

Also I can't host this site on github pages because it doesn't support `PHP` :`(   If you want to see it, go to this link: [college marketplace]([cs.gettysburg.edu/~tangyi02/](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tangyi02/Projects/collegeMarketplace/))
